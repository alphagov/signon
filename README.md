# Signon

Signon is a centralised OAuth2 based single sign-on provider for GDS services that provides username/password and 2-step verification.

## Technical documentation

[Devise] is used to provide username password sign-in, and [Doorkeeper] as an OAuth 2 provider. Details of our interpretation of OAuth are provided in [an accompanying document][auth].

This is a Ruby on Rails app, and should follow [our Rails app conventions][conventions].

You can use the [GOV.UK Docker environment][govuk-docker] to run the application and its tests with all the necessary dependencies. Follow the [usage instructions][docker-usage] to get started.

**Use GOV.UK Docker to run any commands that follow.**

### Running the test suite

```sh
bundle exec rake
```
