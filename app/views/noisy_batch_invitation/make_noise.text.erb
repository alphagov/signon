Hello,

This is to let you know that <%= @user.name %> <%= @user.email %> has uploaded a batch of <%= @batch_invitation.batch_invitation_users.count %> users that will be automatically created.

If you are an admin (or a superadmin), you can review what's in the batch with this link:
<%= batch_invitation_url(@batch_invitation) %>

View the user who created the batch here:
<%= edit_user_url(@user) %>

Kind regards,
<%= t('department.name') %> Signon
