<p>Your <%= link_to 'GOV.UK', "https://www.gov.uk" %> Signon <%= account_name %>, for <%= @resource.email %>, was locked at <%= locked_time %> because the wrong sign on details were entered too many times.</p>

<% if instance_name.present? %>
<p><%= account_name.humanize %> locks do not lock production accounts.</p>
<% end %>

<p>Your account will be unlocked at <%= unlock_time %>. If you need your account unlocked sooner, please contact a managing <%= link_to 'GOV.UK', "https://www.gov.uk" %> editor in your organisation (or your parent organisation).
