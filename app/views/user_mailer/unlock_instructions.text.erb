Hello <%= @resource.name %>,

Your GOV.UK Signon <%= account_name %>, for <%= @resource.email %>, was locked at <%= locked_time %> because the wrong sign on details were entered too many times.

<% if instance_name.present? %>
  <%= account_name.humanize %> locks do not lock production accounts.
<% end %>

Your account will be unlocked at <%= unlock_time %>. If you need your account unlocked sooner, please contact a managing GOV.UK editor in your organisation (or your parent organisation). They can either unlock your account themselves or use the support form to get help from the GOV.UK team.

All the best,

GOV.UK team
