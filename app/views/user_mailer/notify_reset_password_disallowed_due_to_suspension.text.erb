Hello <%= @user.name %>,

Your GOV.UK Signon <%= account_name %>, for <%= @user.email %>, is suspended. You can't request a passphrase reset on a suspended account.

<% if instance_name.present? %>
<%= account_name.humanize %> suspensions do not suspend production accounts.
<% end %>

If you believe your account has been suspended in error, please contact a managing GOV.UK editor in your organisation (or your parent organisation). They can either unsuspend your account themselves or use the support form to get help from the GOV.UK team.

All the best,

GOV.UK team
