GOV.UK Signon accounts are suspended after <%= User::SUSPENSION_THRESHOLD_PERIOD.inspect %> of inactivity.

Your GOV.UK Signon <%= account_name %>, for <%= @user.email %>, will be suspended <%= suspension_time %>. After suspension you won't be able to access any GOV.UK <%= account_name %> applications, eg Whitehall Publisher or Licensing.

<% if instance_name.present? %>
<%= account_name.humanize %> suspensions do not suspend production accounts or remove access to GOV.UK production applications.
<% end %>

If you don't need the account you can ignore these emails.

To stop your account suspension you will need to sign in:

<%= new_user_session_url(protocol: 'https') %>

If youâ€™ve forgotten your passphrase, you can request a new one from the sign in screen.
