<%= t('department.name') %> Signon accounts are suspended after <%= User::SUSPENSION_THRESHOLD_PERIOD.inspect %> of inactivity.

Your <%= t('department.name') %> Signon <%= account_name %>, for <%= @user.email %>, will be suspended <%= suspension_time %>. After suspension you won't be able to access any <%= t('department.name') %> <%= account_name %> publishing applications.

<% if instance_name.present? %>
<%= account_name.humanize %> suspensions do not suspend production accounts or remove access to <%= t('department.name') %> production applications.
<% end %>

If you don't need the account you can ignore these emails.

To stop your account suspension you will need to sign in:

<%= new_user_session_url(protocol: 'https') %>

If you’ve forgotten your passphrase, you can request a new one from the sign in screen.
