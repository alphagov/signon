## How to stop suspension

^ Please do not reply to this email.

To stop your account being suspended, all you have to do is sign in:
<%= new_user_session_url(protocol: 'https') %>

<%= t('department.name') %> Signon accounts are automatically suspended after <%= User::SUSPENSION_THRESHOLD_PERIOD.inspect %> of inactivity.

<% unless GovukEnvironment.current == "production" %>
Please note that Integration account suspensions do not suspend Production accounts.

Find about more about the two kinds of accounts on the [How to Publish on GOV.UK page](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-publish-on-gov-uk/introduction-and-access-to-whitehall-publisher).
