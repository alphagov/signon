Hello <%= @user.name %>,

A Signon administrator has changed your GOV.UK Signon <%= account_name %> email from <%= @email_was %> to <%= @user.email %>.

You will now need to sign in using your new email <%= @user.email %>.

If your email address shouldn't have changed you should contact a managing GOV.UK editor in your organisation or your parent organisation.

All the best,

GOV.UK team
Government Digital Service
