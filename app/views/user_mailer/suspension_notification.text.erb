<%= t('department.name') %> Signon accounts are suspended after <%= User::SUSPENSION_THRESHOLD_PERIOD.inspect %> of inactivity.

Your <%= t('department.name') %> Signon <%= account_name %>, for <%= @user.email %>, has now been suspended and you won't be able to access any <%= t('department.name') %> <%= account_name %> applications, eg Whitehall Publisher or Licensing.

<% if instance_name.present? %>
<%= account_name.humanize %> suspensions do not suspend production accounts or remove access to <%= t('department.name') %> production applications.
<% end %>

If you don't need the account you can ignore this email.

If you do still need the account you will have to contact a managing <%= t('department.name') %> editor in your organisation (or your parent organisation). They can either use the support form to get help from the <%= t('department.name') %> team.
