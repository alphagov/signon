Hello <%= @user.name %>,

GOV.UK Signon accounts are suspended after <%= User::SUSPENSION_THRESHOLD_PERIOD.inspect %> of inactivity.

Your GOV.UK Signon <%= account_name %>, for <%= @user.email %>, has now been suspended and you won't be able to access any GOV.UK <%= account_name %> applications, eg Whitehall Publisher or Licensing.

<% if instance_name.present? %>
<%= account_name.humanize %> suspensions do not suspend production accounts or remove access to GOV.UK production applications.
<% end %>

If you don't need the account you can ignore this email.

If you do still need the account you will have to contact a managing GOV.UK editor in your organisation (or your parent organisation). They can either unsuspend your account themselves or use the support form to get help from the GOV.UK team.
