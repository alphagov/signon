<h1>Your email could not be sent</h1>

<div class="well">
  <div class="alert alert-block">
    <p>That email address has been blacklisted by our mail server. This probably means that the email address does not exist, or it has a problem such as the inbox being full.</p>
    <p>This technical information might be useful:</p>
    <p><code><%= @exception.message %></code></p>
  </div>

  <p>You could navigate back and try again, or follow one of these links:</p>
  <% if current_user.has_role?("admin") %>
    <p><%= link_to "Administer users", admin_users_path %></p>
  <% end %>
  <p><%= link_to "Home", root_path %></p>
